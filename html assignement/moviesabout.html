        <p>In 1995, young Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova are whisked away by their surrogate parents, Alexei Shostakov, originally Russia's Captain America known as the Red Guardian, and former Black Widow Melina Vostokoff from their home in Ohio. As their mission ends, Romanoff and Belova are put through the Red Room for further training.

            21 years later, following the battle between the Avengers at Leipzig/Halle Airport, Romanoff is a fugitive from the government for violating the Sokovia Accords. She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, fleeing to a safehouse in Norway, reuniting with her contact Rick Mason. In Morocco, Belova is still working for the Red Room. Belova kills Oksana, a former Black Widow, only to come in contact with a substance called Red Dust, which removes the Red Room's control over her. She sends this antidote to Romanoff's safehouse in the hopes that she will return to help her.

        <p>Benjamin Solomon Carson, Sr. (b. September 18, 1951) is the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as well as a 2016 presidential candidate, retired neurosurgeon, motivational speaker, and author of inspirational books. He earned a B.A. from Yale University and an M.D. from University of Michigan School of Medicine.

            In his memoir, Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story (1990), Carson and coauthor Cecil Murphey explore how Carson’s gifts from God, his mother and older brother’s influence, and his belief in God and himself allowed him to escape the Detroit ghetto and become a prominent neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins, pioneering new techniques and performing life-saving brain surgery. Following a letter to readers from his mother and an Introduction by his wife, Carson recalls the key stages in his development, from the time he was eight until the peak of his neurosurgery career and launch of his work as an inspirational and motivational speaker and writer.
            
            Starting with the moment that he learns, at age eight, that his father has left the family, leaving Carson’s mother to raise two sons alone, Carson discusses the challenges his family faces in the next years. These include both financial struggles and his mother’s mental health issues. During this time, Carson has a religious experience at a Seventh-day Adventist Church service and determines both to be baptized and to become a doctor.</p>
